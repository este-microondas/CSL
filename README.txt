Hello. This is a launcher that I made for easy and simple launching of a dedicated server in CS2 (Counter Strike 2). So in just a couple of clicks you can play with your friends.
Let me explain what this is: this is the same as launching through shortcuts and parameters, except all of this happens “under the hood” itself. This is not a modification or anything like that.
This is made on the Unity engine, a little strange, but it works, I use it myself.

Now how to actually use it:
